DOWNLOAD DIRECTLY FROM THEIR OFFICIAL WEBSITE

https://raysan5.itch.io/raylib/purchase?popup=1

This is the official site of raylib. Just Copy paste this link in your browser and press the "No thanks, just take me to the downloads" button. Once it is downloaded, press extract. Some systems may say that its not safe to run, but dont worry, just press the more info option and press "run anyways" when u extract raylib from the downloaded file

This would create a copy of your RAYLIB files in OS(C:) drive. Make sure that a copy is made, for only when this happens, you can proceed to run our code.

RUNNING THE CODE

The zip file for running this code has been given in the same drive link in which this ReadMe file has been attached. 

Steps to have a copy of our code in the proper place:
1) Download the given zip file wherever you want, but preferably downloads.
2) Extract the given zip file in the file path given
   "C:\raylib\raylib"
3)The two raylibs are NOT a typo, please save our zip file named "Team2_PACMAN_CSEC" in the specified location.


Steps to run the code once you save it
1) Open the file "Team2_PACMAN_CSEC" which you have just installed
2) In that, there would be two folders, namely "Resources" which contain the images, audios and fonts necessary, and another folder named "Codes", containing the code, the executable, and a file to       save high score 
3)The executable would have the raylib icon and be named "PACMAN". Please open that file and play the game


NOTE:
1)Some systems might throw a warning that the zip file is not safe. We assure you that the file is free of any viruses and is completely safe to open. When such sorts of pop ups appear, just click more info and press "Run anyway" when extracting the zip file
